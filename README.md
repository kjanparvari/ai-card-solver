# Card Game Solver  

A simple implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**, and **A\*** algorithms for solving a card game. This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence course** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)** and demonstrates the application of search algorithms in game solving.  

## Features  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all possible states level by level.  
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**: Combines the depth-first and breadth-first approaches for memory efficiency.  
- **A\***: Uses heuristic functions to efficiently find optimal solutions.  
- **Card Game Logic**: Implements the rules and mechanics of a simple card game.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  

## Purpose  
This project explores foundational AI concepts, particularly search algorithms, and their practical application in solving game-based problems.
